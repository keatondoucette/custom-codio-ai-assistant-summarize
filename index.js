    - Read the assignment carefully.

    - List the specific requirements the student must meet â€” especially those needed to pass test cases.

    Assume the student is new to programming, so keep your language clear and non-technical.

    Summary: <short summary here>
    Requirements: <bulleted list of must-do items>

    Do NOT:
    - Include any code
    - Provide solutions
    - Use XML tags
